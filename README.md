Trade Analytics 
India’s merchandise trade (exports and imports) expands steadily from 2015–2022, but the overall balance stays in deficit due to dependence on imports of energy, electronics, and capital goods.
Machinery exports (HSN 84 proxy) show a clear, consistent upward trend, pointing to deeper integration into global manufacturing value chains.
The machinery export growth pattern is smooth and structural (not driven by one‑off spikes), suggesting underlying capability building.

Top merchandise trading partners: US, China, UAE, and major EU economies.
India tends to have large trade surpluses with markets that import its textiles, clothing, pharmaceuticals, and IT‑intensive goods/services.
Largest trade deficits are with suppliers of crude oil, electronics, and capital goods (notably China and major oil exporters).
Overall profile: strong export niches coexisting with heavy import dependence in fuels and high‑tech inputs.

Key export groups in 2022: manufactures, fuels and mining products, machinery and transport equipment, plus important agricultural and food products.
Strong positions: pharmaceuticals, textiles and clothing, and agro‑food – all labour‑intensive, high‑employment sectors.
Sectors to protect/manage: electronics and critical high‑tech intermediates where India runs large, persistent deficits.
Sectors to promote: machinery and capital goods, pharmaceuticals, and value‑added agro/textile products where India already has traction and room to move up the value chain.

Forecast & Recommendations (Machinery)
A Holt–Winters (Exponential Smoothing) model on annual machinery export values projects a steady increase over the next 3 years, roughly linear year‑on‑year growth, in line with the recent trend (about 94.7k → 100.3k → 106.0k in the model’s units).
This signals that current policies and capabilities support gradual upgrading, but there is room to accelerate.
Recommendations:

Scale up production‑linked incentives and tech‑upgradation support for machinery and capital‑goods exporters.
Simplify logistics and customs processes to reduce export frictions and delivery times.
Expand export credit/insurance for SMEs in machinery global value chains.
Use trade agreements and standards cooperation to open new markets for Indian machinery, while securing critical high‑tech inputs domestically or via resilient supply arrangements.
